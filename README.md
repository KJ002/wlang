# The W Programming Language

A highly abstracted [array-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_programming) mathematical programming language.

## Who should use W?

The W programming language can be used for short scripts and demonstrations of algorithms. It would lend itself to a scientific computing and engineering setting.

## Core Concept

The W Programming Language's fusion of functional and array based paradigms makes it a programming language unlike any other. it fuses functional and array based paradigms. The core idea is that each line of code is it's own array that then consumes and evaluates it's self. To achieve this W try's to abstract it's self as much as it can. For example functions, procedures and variables all fall under what in W is known as a container.
